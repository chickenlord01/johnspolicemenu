<h4>Changing permissions</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to allow players to use the menu, it is as easy as adding `add_ace identifier.ADDIDENTIFIERHERE policemenu.open allow #PLAYERNAME`</li>
<li>If you would like to allow players to use a loadout, it is as easy as adding `add_ace identifier.ADDIDENTIFIERHERE policemenu.LOADOUTNAME allow #PLAYERNAME`</li>

server.cfg example

```
add_ace identifier.steam:1100001155f7f59 policemenu.open allow #John
add_ace identifier.steam:1100001155f7f59 policemenu.sru allow #John
```

You can also allow groups of players:
```
add_ace group.leo policemenu.open allow
add_ace group.sru policemenu.sru allow
```
</ul>


<h4>Modifying Config</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to add more weapons, simply add the name to the weapons>spawn portion. You can find a full list of weapons in the weapons.lua file.</li>
<li>If you would like to add more attachments, simply add the name of the weapon.attachment. For example: WEAPON_PISTOL.suppressor. You can find a full list of weapon attachments in the weapons.lua file.</li>
<li>Note: I tried my best to make it very straight forward for people that are new to development or have no idea what they are looking at. If you have questions don't be afraid to reach out on discord!</li>
</ul>
